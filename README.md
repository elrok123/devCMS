devCMS
======

This app is a simple content management system intended for developers, it allows pure HTML to used when creating content, and also allows direct CSS manipulation, cutting any corners it can, minimising troubles cause by overcluttered Content Management dashboards/panels. 


I first started developing this app when I was 19 doing work for a small hosting company. The app was an alternative to using third party CMS's like Joomla, which the company was using before, and it would annoy me how the system would filter my content, after all I was a developer and knew how to write what I wanted to write, so I didn't need the system to filter it for me.


The systems was written in PHP, it makes use of JavaScript for AJAX and styling, there are a large amount of unused JavaScript files in this repo which I have written, these files can be used to apply certain features to frontend sections/pages etc. 


If I was to rewrite the system I would definitely opt for a Ruby base accompanied with the Ruby on Rails framework, but unfortunately when I was 19 I only knew PHP for web development, and I am sort of stuck with the product now, as it would take a large amount of time to rewrite the system, when this system already functions very well, and has had several huge revisions to enhance security and suchlike, so this version is well maintained, and I intend on maintaining the app until I decide to write another.


This system is not intended to be complex, or show new features etc, it's in no way intended for public use, this repo is merely here to maintain changes and keep track of problems.
